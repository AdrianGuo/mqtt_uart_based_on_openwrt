BUILDING

If your system is POSIX compliant (or reasonably close to being so), just
running make will generate a binary.

The Makefile has a number of knobs to adjust the compiled in defaults.

Some systems don't have a working implementation of poll(2), among them
Mac OS X 10.4.  You can enable a workaround in the Makefile by adding
-DHAS_BROKEN_POLL to the CFLAGS.
